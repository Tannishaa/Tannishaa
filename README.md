I am a **Cloud Engineer & Python Developer** focused on building high-availability serverless systems. As an **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**, I specialize in bridging the gap between cloud theory and production-grade infrastructure through automation and event-driven design.

- 🎓 **BCA (Final Year)** @ Banasthali Vidyapith
- ☁️ **AWS Certified** (CLF-C02)
- 🛠 Currently building the **Winter Arc** series: A trilogy of distributed cloud tools.
- 🔭 Deep-diving into **Asynchronous Processing**, **Distributed Locking**, and **Cost-Optimization**.

### Featured Projects

**1. Flux-Order: High-Concurrency Ticketing Engine**
> *A resilient microservices architecture designed to handle flash sales without inventory overselling.*
* **Distributed Locking:** Implemented **Redis Mutex (SET NX)** to eliminate race conditions during high-concurrency bursts (50+ req/sec).
* **Infrastructure as Code:** Fully automated resource provisioning (SQS, DynamoDB, Networking) using **Terraform**.
* **Observability:** Built a real-time "Mission Control" dashboard using **Streamlit** to visualize queue depth and sales velocity.

**2. Bill-E: Serverless AI Audit & Risk Engine**
> *A zero-idle pipeline that detects financial fraud in real-time.*
* **Fraud Detection:** Engineered a Python-based **Heuristic Risk Engine** that flags anomalies (e.g., "Casino") and assigns dynamic risk scores.
* **The Snitch Protocol:** Automated "Crisis Trigger" system via **AWS SNS** that alerts admins instantly when high-risk transactions are detected.
* **Cost Optimization:** Decoupled architecture using **S3 event triggers**, ensuring the system costs $0 when idle.

**3. Vibe-Check: Real-Time Sentiment Analysis API**
> *A serverless API for sub-millisecond customer feedback analysis.*
* **Architecture:** Pure serverless design using **AWS Lambda**, **API Gateway**, and **SNS**.
* **Engine:** Engineered a **Rule-Based Filtering System** to bypass expensive ML inference costs while maintaining high accuracy.
* **Alerting:** Automated feedback loops that flag negative sentiment via SNS Email alerts in < 2 seconds.
